## Description

This is an arcade game devised after the classic game Frogger. The player, which starts at the bottom of the screen, must make its way up to the water without running into any "enemy" bugs, which move at varying speeds. The player can move up, down, left, and right but not off screen. If the player collides into an enemy bug, the player must start over from the bottom again. When the player reaches the water, the game is won and the user has a choice to play again if he or she wishes.
